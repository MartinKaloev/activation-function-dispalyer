I. This code support discussions from paper: 
"Comparative Analysis of Activation Functions Used in the Hidden Layers of Deep Neural Networks"
with doi:
DOI: 10.1109/HORA52670.2021.9461312

II. What is in the code:
Neural Net trained for classification. In "results" you fill find images of pasterns of signal values in hidden layers of the neural net. 
This illustrates how different activation function do change hidden layers signals, it answers the question are different activation function mutually interchangeable after training process is completed

III. How to start:
-For interaction with the code: do start *.ipynb file in Jupiterlab. This maybe done by selecting "JypiterLab icon button" and selection the *.ipynb file after loading process and pressing the (triangle button) play button. This will generate fresh examples of images of patterns of signals in activation functions.
-Alternatively use the play button (reproduce button) this will start default starting script 

IV. Raw codes:
If you want to use "raw code" those are found in directory: "Raw_codes"
There is Keras version and Pytorch version. Alternatively:
